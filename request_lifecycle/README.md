<h3>Step 1: Entry point</h3>

When an HTTP request comes into your Laravel application, the web server (like Nginx or Apache) routes it to the ``` index.php ``` file, which serves as the entry point for your Laravel application. This routing is typically configured in the server's configuration files.

The next step in the Laravel request lifecycle after the request has been routed to the index.php file by the web server involves bootstrapping the Laravel application and handling the request within the framework.

Bootstrapping Laravel: After including the ``` bootstrap/app.php ``` file in ``` index.php ```, Laravel is bootstrapped. This involves setting up configurations, initializing services, and preparing the application to handle the incoming request.

<b>In more technical terms, when we say Laravel is "bootstrapped," it means that the essential components of the Laravel framework have been loaded and configured. This includes:</b>

<b>1.Loading Configuration:</b> Loading configuration files that define settings for various aspects of the application, such as database connections, caching mechanisms, and service providers.

<b>2.Setting Up Dependencies:</b> Initializing the Composer autoloader, which allows the application to automatically load PHP classes and libraries as needed.

<b>3.Registering Services:</b> Registering service providers, which are responsible for binding classes into the Laravel service container, providing functionality like database access, queue management, and session handling.

<b>4.Initializing Environment:</b> Preparing the application environment, including handling environment-specific settings and configurations.

<b>5.Preparing Application:</b> Preparing the application instance itself, setting up error handling, logging, and other global features.

<h3>Step 2: Kernels</h3>

Next, the incoming request is sent to either the HTTP kernel or the console kernel, using the handleRequest or handleCommand methods of the application instance, depending on the type of request entering the application. 


If the incoming request is of type HTTP, for example, if it comes from the browser, the main kernel is ``` app/Http/Kernel.php ```.

If the incoming request is of Console type, for example, if it comes from the terminal, the main kernel is ``` app/Console/Kernel.php ```.


Requests in the kernel are passed to the handle() method, whose job is to receive the request and return the response.
